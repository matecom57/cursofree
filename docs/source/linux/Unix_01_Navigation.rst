Unix Tutorial #1: Navigating the directory tree
===============================================

.. note::
    Topics covered: Directories, navigation
    
    Commands used: pwd, cd, ls


Overview
--------

Like other operating systems, Unix organizes folders and files using a directory tree - also known as a directory hierarchy, or directory structure. At 
the top of the hierarchy is a folder called ``root``, written as a forward slash (``/``). All other folders (also known as directories) are contained 
within the ``root`` folder, and those folders in turn can contain other folders.

Think of the directory hierarchy as an upside-down tree: ``root`` is the base of the tree, and all of the other folders extend from it, just as 
branches extend from the trunk.

    Root, symbolized by a forward slash (``/``), is the highest level of the directory tree; it contains folders such as ``bin`` (which contains 
binaries, or Unix commands such as pwd, cd, ls, and so on), ``mnt`` (which shows any currently mounted drives, such as external hard drives), and 
``Users``. These directories in turn contain other directories - for example, ``Users`` contains the folder ``andrew``, which in turn contains the 
``Desktop``, ``Applications``, and ``Downloads`` directories. This is how folders and files are organized within a directory tree.
    

To navigate around your computer, you will need to know the commands ``pwd``, ``cd``, and ``ls``. ``pwd`` stands for “print working directory”; ``cd`` 
stands for “change directory”; and ``ls`` stands for “list”, as in “list the contents of the current directory.” This is analogous to pointing and 
clicking on a folder on your Desktop, and then seeing what’s inside. Note that in these tutorials, the words “folder” and “directory” are used 
interchangeably.

    Navigation in Unix is the same thing as pointing and clicking in a typical graphical user interface. For example, if you have the folder 
"ExperimentFolder" on my Desktop, you can point and double-click to open it. You can do the same thing by typing ``cd ~/Desktop/ExperimentFolder`` in 
the Terminal and then typing ``ls`` to see what's in the directory.

Exercises
---------

When you're done watching the video, try the following exercises:

1.  Type ``ls ~`` and note what it returns; then type ``ls ~/Desktop``. How are the outputs different? Why?

2.  Navigate to the Desktop by typing ``cd ~/Desktop``. Type ``pwd`` and note what the path is. Then create a new directory using the ``mkdir`` 
command, choosing a name for the directory on your own. Navigate into that new directory and think about how your current path has been updated. Does 
that match what you see from typing ``pwd`` from your new directory?

3.  Define the terms ``cd``, ``ls``, and ``pwd`` in your own words.
